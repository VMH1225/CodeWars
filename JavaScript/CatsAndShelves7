function solution(start, finish) 
{
  return Math.floor((finish - start) / 3) + (finish - start) % 3
}

/*PREP
Parameters: 'start' a positive integer denoting where the shelf where the cat begins 
            'finish' a positive integer denoting where the shelf the cat will end on
Return: the minimum number of jumps the cat needs to make to reach 'finish' from 'start' position
Examples: (1,5) => 2, (1,4) => 1
Pseudocode: evaluate (finish - start) to get the total number of shelves the cat needs to climb
            The cat can climb 3 steps at one time. So divide the total steps by 3. This amount 
            is the amount of steps the cat can climb in increments of 3.
            Get the remainder of the total steps divided by 3. This is the amount of 
            steps the cat climbs by one. 
            Add these two values and return the sum*/

// Example 
console.log(solution(1,5))
